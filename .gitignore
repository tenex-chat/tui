# UniFFI generated bindings (generated by scripts/generate-swift-bindings.sh)
# Note: tenex_core.swift is committed as a placeholder stub so that `tuist generate`
# always includes it in Xcode compile sources (the pre-build script replaces the
# placeholder with real UniFFI content before the Swift compiler runs).
